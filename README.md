Why yes I do love to read!

## Description

For this final module, we were given some starter code that functioned with Google's Book API, and tasked with refactoring it with GraphQL and an Apollo Server. It was a bait and switch in a way, in that it had to function the same way, but the logic needed to switched. Every little piece had to connect correctly, and a myriad of errors on the way to the final product made this another trial of errors. Very fitting for the final challenge of the bootcamp.

## Installation

No installation is required in this module, you need only access through the live link here:

## Usage

For starters, you need to make an account, as you won't have access to the accounts made when testing the application in the back end. Once you've made an account (don't forget your email and password!), you'll be able to search through countless books thanks to Google's API, and save them into your own personal library (wishlist). You can add and delete them as needed, as well as log out and log back in.

## Credits

For this final module, the cohort really came together to try and solve this surprisingly challenging module. The support in the eleventh hour was super strong, and always appreciated.
